# Technical Safety Requirements

`Technical safety` is the foremost priority in all activities related to work and technology.

##   <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>1. Safety Warnings When Using the Equipment</span>

- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**High Voltage:**</span> The devices in the electrical cabinet operate at high voltage, which can be life-threatening. Always ensure the power is disconnected before performing any maintenance or installation work.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Electric Leakage Protection:**</span> Use the Hyundai 30A ELCB circuit breaker to protect the electrical system from overloads, short circuits, and electric leakage. Ensure all electrical connections are secure and show no signs of damage.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Electric Shock Hazard:**</span> Always wear insulated gloves and use insulated tools when working with the electrical cabinet.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Ventilation:**</span> Ensure the area around the electrical cabinet has adequate ventilation to prevent overheating.


##  <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>2. Safety Instructions for Users</span>
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Regular Inspections:**</span> Conduct regular inspections of the devices in the electrical cabinet to ensure stable and safe operation. Pay special attention to the condition of the wiring and protective devices like circuit breakers and relays.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Proper Equipment Usage:**</span> Only use the devices when fully instructed on how to operate them. Avoid using the equipment beyond its design specifications or in unsuitable environmental conditions.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Safety Training:**</span> Users should be trained in electrical safety and basic first aid measures in case of an emergency.


## <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>3. Environmental Operating Requirements</span>
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Temperature:**</span> The devices in the electrical cabinet are designed to operate well within a temperature range of -20°C to 85°C, depending on the specific device. Avoid installing the equipment in environments that exceed these temperature limits.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Humidity:**</span> Ensure that the humidity in the installation area does not exceed 85% RH to prevent condensation and potential damage to the equipment.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Ventilation:**</span> The installation area must have a good ventilation system to minimize the risk of overheating.


## <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>4. Power Supply Requirements</span>
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Supply Voltage:**</span> Devices such as the Timer THC30A and Hyundai ELCB use a 220V AC power supply, while the Modbus RTU Relay 32CH and Yolo Uno require 7~36V and 3.3V ~ 5V, respectively.
- <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>**Voltage Stability:**</span> Ensure the power supply to the devices is stable, with no sudden voltage drops or surges to avoid damage.
